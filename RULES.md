# Project Rules

## Documentation Policy
- **Update README.md**: Every change MUST include updates to `README.md` to reflect:
  - New features or logic changes.
  - Changes to the data models or state management.
  - Updates to build or run instructions.
  - Any new known issues or "gotchas".
  
  The `README.md` serves as the source of truth for the project's current state and mechanics.

- **Update .antigravity Documentation**: Every change MUST be reflected in the `.antigravity` directory using the "Inside-Out" documentation structure.
  - Follow the best practices: Inner Layer (Math/Algo) -> Middle Layer (State) -> Outer Layer (UI).
  - Ensure the documentation remains an accurate technical reference for the codebase.
